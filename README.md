# GitTrimmer
Git Trimmer is a demo project for DataJuggler.Core.UltimateHelper and DataJuggler.Win.Controls, but it is also useful in that it helps you find .png and / or .jpg files in a project folder, but not used by a project. This is specifically for C# projects, and will not work for all project types.

Also, if content is just expected to be there like a web project, then this will not work.

I mainly use this for the 'This will look good idea, that turned out to be an eye sore, but wasn't thrown away.

Use this project at your own risk, as this has not been tested througly.

I did just ran on about 5 projects and it worked. On a few projects I had to go hunt for the file in the External Folder and restore it.
